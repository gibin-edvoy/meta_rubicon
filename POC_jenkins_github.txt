Jenkins Github Integration POC

1. The ability to pull code from GitHub is made possible through the Jenkins Git Plugin.
2. The ability to trigger Jenkins build when Github commits occur is provided through the
Jenkins GitHub plugin.
3. The ability to trigger Jenkins builds remotely will not work with GitHub and will result in 403 crumb error.
4. To overcome this error and the ability to trigger Jenkins builds remotely(when commit happens in github) will achieve by Jenkins Github webhook.
5. To implement a webhook, the GitHub hook trigger for GITScm polling must be enables on the jenkins build job.
6. We can automate the integration feature, when the GitHub with Jenkins integration plugin is configured through the Jenkins administrative console.
7. When the plugin is configured, these additional Jenkins with GitHub features are activated:
    • Hyperlinks between Jenkins and GitHub are included on the summary page of you build.
    • Triggers performed by groking HTTP POSTS happen automatically.
    • Other plugins installed in Jenkins can take advantage of GitHub plugin APIs and features
